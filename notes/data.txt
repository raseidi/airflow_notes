add data in runtime has a notation: two pairs of brackets {{}}

seeing docs we have template_fields and tempalte_ext, which accept jinja template; fields are the operator params and ext is the extension of files; we can customize such fields and extension by creating a custom class that inherits the reference operator
this is useful since by default we are not able to inject the param "parameters" (in PostgressOperator) at runtime
