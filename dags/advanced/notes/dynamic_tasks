Using dictionaries
    - it doesnt seem too dynamic since we need a static dict; maybe it changes if we gather jsons from web
    - a useful use case could be like having two generic tasks that preprocesses jsons from different sources, and if the first one failed the second one would alert us
    - one dag can call several times the same method for grouping tasks, but we need to add a param to handle the colision of repeated ids.

Branching
    - choose a task according to a condition (dates, sql table value, etc)
    - trigger rule: defines the behaviour of your task and why it will be triggered
        - default: all_success, i.e. if all parents have successed
        - other examples: all_failed, all_done, one_failed, one_success, none_failed
        - notice the diff between one_success and none_failed_or_skipped: 
            - the latter one says that we execute if at least one successed AND all have been completed
